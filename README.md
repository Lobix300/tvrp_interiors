# tvrp_interiors
Hello, this is the best script for interiors in FiveM. Where you can customize everything without any limitations.

## Installation
Copy the folder with the Lua files and place them into your resources folder just like any other script. Be sure to add the name of the resource to your citmp-server.yml or your server.cfg files.

## Usage
You can easily see how to add a new location in my example script. It provides an example for the Bahamas Mamas. You are free to edit the values to your liking. ;D

## Demo
Here is a video to show the script in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9zTy8UOIvo so hopefully you can agree with me that it's a fairly good script.

thx to supa for fixing my bad english lol ^^ ;D
